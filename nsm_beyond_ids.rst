Network Security Monitoring - Going beyond Intrusion Detection

Today the cyber threat is greater than it has ever been before. In spite of the security devices almost all enterprises have deployed, cyber attacks are still succeeding.
 
However, even if you are attacked, you can still stop damage being done to your network if you catch the attack in time. But you can’t mitigate against a threat unless you first detect it. So how do you know if you are being attacked? Or if have been attacked already?

Networ Security Monitoring

NSM is not an IDS, although it relies on IDS-like products as part of an integrated data collection and analysis suite. NSM involves collecting the full spectrum of data types (event, session, full content and statistical) needed to identify and validate intrusions.
Based upon the information contained within your network logs and using a range of sophisticated security technologies we will search for the threats you face.
Upon detection, we will analyse the threats we find, and then provide your security staff with prioritised, clear and actionable information on the threats we discover and how you can address them.
By trusting threat detection and analysis using NSM, you can improve the effectiveness of your IT security, without adding additional security devices to your network.
Network Security Monitoring (NSM) is, put simply, monitoring your network for security related events. It might be proactive, when used to identify vulnerabilities or expiring SSL certificates, or it might be reactive, such as in incident response and network forensics. Whether you’re tracking an adversary or trying to keep malware at bay, NSM provides context, intelligence and situational awareness of your network. There are some commercial solutions that get close to what Security Onion provides, but very few contain the vast capabilities of Security Onion in one package.
