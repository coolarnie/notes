Deployment of Honeypot

Honeypot
a honeypot is a computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. Several honeypots could be combined to an entire honeynet.
Honeynet is a network that contains one or more honeypots. Honeynet is an architecture creates a highly controlled network, we can control and monitor all activity that happens within it. Then, we place our target systems, honeypots within that architecture.

Modern Honey Network
Open source platform for managing honeypots, collecting and analyzing their data, makes it very easy to deploy new honeypots and get data flowing. It automates management tasks.

Suggestion: Evaluate and implement Honeypot inside the firewall 
- Setup a decoy for the bad guys is a good starting point! ;) we can use it as an early warning system. 

Build a fake production virtual honeypot as a security resource that use as a sensor (for prevention, detection, information gathering and responsive measures) in order to provide early warning of potential intruders, identify flaws in security strategies and improve current overall security awareness.
 
Honeypot can be used simply to confuse and deflect attacks or to collect evidence. It can be highly effective and efficient of alert teams of a potential compromised or attack. However, to be effective requires it to be well implemented, maintained and monitored.

If the evaluation go well, then we should progress to implement the modern honey network.
