Mitigation Strategy to mitigate targeted Cyber Intrusions
 
- Application whitelisting
- Patch applications and operating system vulnerabilities
- Restrict administrative privileges
- User application configuration hardening
- Automated dynamic analysis
- Operating system generic exploit mitigation
- Network-based \ Host-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention System
- Disable local administrator accounts
- Network segmentation and segregation
- Multi-factor authentication
- Software-based application firewall, blocking incoming\outgoing network traffic
- Non-persistent virtualised sandboxed trusted operating environment
- Centralised and time-synchronised logging of successful and failed computer events and allowed\blocked network activity
- Email\Web content filtering
- Web domain whitelisting for all domains
- Block spoofed emails
- Workstation and server configuration management
- Antivirus software using heuristics and automated Internet-based reputation ratings
- Deny direct Internet access from workstations
- Server application configuration hardening
- Enforce a strong passphrase policy
- Removable and portable media control
- Restrict access to Server Message Block (SMB) and NetBIOS
- User education
- Workstation inspection of Microsoft Office files
- Signature-based antivirus software
- TLS encryption between email servers
- Block attempts to access websites by their IP address
- Gateway blacklisting
- Capture network traffic
