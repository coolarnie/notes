Detecting and Preventing Rogue Devices on the Network 

Mitigation Strategy
Detect -> Block -> Locate -> Eliminate rogues

1. WLAN infrastructure reporting
2. Manual rogue AP scanning
3. Wired network auditing

- Deploy Wireless intrusion detection systems
- Keep Security Patches Up-to-date
- MAC address list check
- Create DDOS attack to the rogue AP
- AP Site Survey on client side
- MAC list checking, MAC spoofing checking, and RF jamming checking

# Rogue Detection and Blocking - Continuous Process

Rogue detection and blocking is a continuous process involving at least three components:
• A dedicated piece of hardware probe/sensor to monitor the air and identify network behavior
• A central IDS engine that gathers inputs from many such probes/sensors and helps in pinpointing a device as rogue.
• A network management software that can talk to the wired network, identify the switch port to which the rogue AP is connected and shutdown the port.
