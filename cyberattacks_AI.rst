It may take several years or even decades, but hackers won't necessarily always be human. AI - a technology that also promises to revolutionize cybersecurity could one day become the go-to hacking tool. 

Theoretically, the technology can be used to perfect any coding, ridding it of exploitable flaws. But what if that power was used for malicious purposes? The future of cyberdefense might also pave the way for a new era of hacking.

So it’s not hard for security experts to imagine a potential dark side - one where AIs can build or control powerful cyberweapons. Melski pointed to the case of Stuxnet, a malicious computer worm designed to disrupt Iran's nuclear program.  

Apparently, this is what you need to run a AI CyberSec platform: Computers, sensors, routers,bridges, algorithms, learning trees, database.
 
In today's world, many hacks occur after a phishing email containing malware is sent to the target. In other instances, the victims secured their logins with weak passwords or forgot to upgrade their software with the latest patch which making them easier to hack.

AI technologies like machine learning have shown the potential to resolve some of these problems, said Justin Fier, director for cyberintelligence at security firm Darktrace. But it may only be a matter of time before the hackers eventually upgrade their arsenal.

MIT - AI²: an AI-driven predictive cybersecurity platform - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6Hf1O_vpwQ

Description: In a new paper, researchers from CSAIL and the machine-learning start-up PatternEx have demonstrated an artificial-intelligence platform called “AI²” that can predict 85% of cyber-attacks, by continuously incorporating input from human experts.

To predict attacks, AI² combs through data and detects suspicious activity by clustering the data into meaningful patterns using unsupervised machine-learning. It then presents this activity to human analysts who confirm which events are actual attacks, and incorporates that feedback into its models for the next set of data.
